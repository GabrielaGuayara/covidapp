The COVID-19 Data Collection is an application aimed at people searching for accurate, brief and timely information about the live cases and historical data of this disease. Currently, different COVID-19 vaccines could protect people against this disease, causing those who are fully vaccinated to stop taking safety precautions to prevent the spread of the virus. Therefore, this application was born to provide information that people could use to create statistical charts that demonstrate how severe the impact of COVID-19 was on individualâ€™s lives across the world and encourage them to continue taking precautions that will help end the pandemic.

Moreover, The COVID-19 Data Collection App is a module 2 project created to show my learning and knowledge about Reactjs, a front-end JavaScript library. This library allowed me to make this application using less code than my previous project, in which I only used JavaScript. In addition, I have used three unique APIs and a fetch method to get the data I needed for this project. Besides, my code demonstrates that I mostly use function components as I prefer to manage state and react lifecycles using some reaction hooks, like useState, useReducer, useContext and use effect.

Finally, this is my second project in my Software Engineering training, so many things need to be fixed. Therefore, I would like to receive comments that will help me improve my application. I would appreciate it.
